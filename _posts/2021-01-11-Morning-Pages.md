title: Thanks, Morning Pages!

---

My morning journal consists of 3 section. 

1. I will let go of ...
2. I am grateful...
3. Today my focus is

The 2nd and the third is intuitive, but the first part is adapted from morning pages from Julia Camerons Artist's Way. The role of morning pages is "spiritual windshield wipers". It cleanses our tangled thoughts. As Tim Ferriss quotes, *“Once we get those muddy, maddening, confusing thoughts [nebulous worries, jitters, and preoccupations] on the page, we face our day with clearer eyes.”* 

Once I started with the number 1, I felt less guilty what I haven't done. Most of time, especially when I haven't achieved what I planned, I am reluctant to come back to where I should. And it makes me more procrastinate. But if I admit, i.e. if I let go of, then I can move on, without regretting too much, hence too long. I am just a normal person, so it happens what I should let go.

Why I am writing this? Last saturday was not no.zero.day, in terms of what I defined. It was zero.coding.day. 

Practicing No.Zero.Days is good, but it needs to be adjusted, since "boot camp" is over. Boot camp time was for me like vacuum-packed situation. My husband and even my kid supported intensively. Now, it is time to juggle with my personal boot camp in real situation.

Adjust 1:

Six days per week is my goal for coding. if I can make it one line/hour of code for 7th day of the week, then it is like whipped cream over cappuccino.

Adjust 2:

Blogging in English on GitHub, in Korean on Brunch once a week each. If I write more, that's a  Marocchino.

Wow, I made more than two extra fancy coffees just by adjusting the plan, bc I know I blog more than once a week ^^;

But still I am on the right track of No.Zero.Exercise.Days with yoga and bike.
