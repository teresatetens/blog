title: Using template needs knowledge

---

Today I failed dramatically. So forgive my tragic monologue. Shamelessly, I wanted to go easy. I didn't even have least due diligence of blindly following the tutorials. I took a template and edit the minimal required fields. Without any knowledge of SASS and Gatsby, I could not deploy it. I am talking about portfolio. 

> BUT it was still another no zero day.

BTW I happened to have a monthly stand up with Kene. We had problem by deploying Pokemon project on Netlify and he figured it out. 

And we shared our last 4 weeks and agreed that this "standup" helps both of us, so we would meet on every or every other thursday and check each other.  

By the way regarding "Page Not Found Error on Netlify Reactjs React Router.":

1. put  _redirects file not only in the build directory, but also into the public folder : https://dev.to/rajeshroyal/page-not-found-error-on-netlify-reactjs-react-router-solved-43oa
2. For building command use "CI= npm run build" instead "npm run build"  : https://community.netlify.com/t/new-ci-true-build-configuration-treating-warnings-as-errors-because-process-env-ci-true/14434/35

Tomorrow, I will start building my portfolio with the language which I know.
