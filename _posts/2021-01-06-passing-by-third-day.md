title: Yes, the third no zero day! 
---

As a Korean, completing the third day on one's resolution means a lot, bc there is a saying, your resolution breaks on the third day! 
Today, I found my rhythm again. After the boot camp, I have been thru a sort of burn-out syndrome. I couldn't find myself concentrating on anything.

##### No.zero.days:

- No.zero.exercises: With 20 minutes of morning yoga, I could defeat stiffness. Yoga and jogging are the best methods to get out of sluggishness
- No.zero.coding: Then I started directly on Codecademy JavaScript, tackled bite-size coding projects. Ca 3hrs 30mins. I was a bit wandering, bc I started from the basics. My mind was like, should I start from authentication? No no no, I had almost 4 weeks of hiatus, which means I need to warm up again. Plus, I want to get a CERTIFICATE!!! And it was the right decision. I could see what I couldn’t see before. Yes, sometimes, or quite often, following Codecademy is cumbersome. But, I just go on.
- No.zero.reading: read a Korean book called “Reboot”. It was an easy written book for preparation for the post-pandemic era. 1hr48min
- No.zero.application: not completely applied but I replied to an agent, who contacted me on LinkedIn.
