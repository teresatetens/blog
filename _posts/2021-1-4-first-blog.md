I committed to myself to "No Zero Days" as my new year's resolution.

I did first round of #100DaysOfCode but in the middle of the round, I started the boot camp, so it feels somehow free ride. 

After the boot camp, I had sort of burnt-out procrastinated but still I was looking for some guide.

Yesterday I found these two articles below and decided my no zero days.

1. write blog as my daily-standup : it would be a journal to my post boot camp dev journey. Inspired from swyx and other devs, I decided to use github as my blog platform.
2. code every day: it could be another 100 days of code. But this time I would blog and twitter what I code everyday. Goal is to finish CodeCademy Full Stack Course until March and also to finish or polish my unfinished projects of last 15 weeks.
3. exercise: even if it is one push-up, one burpee or one yoga-stance, no.zero.days
4. read and note: goal is 30 mins read no.zero.days.
5. apply: after polishing the CV, i would follow the guide of haseeb.
