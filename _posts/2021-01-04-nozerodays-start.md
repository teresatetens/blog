2020.1.4. Day1 of No Zero Days

1. No zero application : Finally I applied for one company as a "raw application". Customizing the cover letter and input into job platform are the big and ugly frog at the moment. And kept these on the spreadsheet. Should complete more Job platform at least as a draft. If I wait until I get it satisfying, I would never complete. 

2. No zero study: started the codecademy full-stack course aiming the certificates. Still having a hard time to concentrate. If feels like what I am doing is another time dragging. It is time to build a project or more precisely time to finish unfinished. Tomorrow I will revisit the JavaScript via codecademy as well as via udemy course, that I bought with the time sale of 90% off.

3. No zero exercise: biked 7 km. And I will do the night yoga before going to bed. 

4. No zero writing: I started and I did write something today. it counts for making it as my habit. 

   Bye today, hello tomorrow it is already 0:08 AM.
