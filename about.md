I'm Teresa, a junior full stack web developer from Hamburg.

### More Information

Just finished the boot camp and I am looking for opportunities to grow further, become better and make a valuable contribution. Starting learning in public, I would write down how I fulfill my "No Zero Days". I hope this would help anybody, as I got inspired and helped from the other developers.
